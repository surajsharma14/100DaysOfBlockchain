 ## Day 1.  
# Introduction
The internet has been around for almost half a century now. Even if it is almost unrecognizable, ever since it went public in the nineties, its use remains as widespread as ever, making it one of mankind’s greatest inventions since the humble “wheel”.

Now, even if the underlying technologies remain the same, improvements in terms of quality of service and bandwidth has resulted in the internet becoming an integral part of our lives. The TCP/IP suite of protocols remain in use at various layers with its fundamental protocols still connecting devices today across the globe so as to send data in the form of text, images, audio and video.

The internet has moved away from being more than just a tool for academics, the military or government. It has redefined or reinvented the way we communicate, socialize, consume content and even take care of our daily needs. Be it digital newspapers, email, video streaming, Internet telephony, instant messaging, social networking and online shopping, all these services offered over the internet have made it indispensable.

Yet it’s not all rainbows and sunshine: the commercialization of the internet has brought about unintended consequences and threats that most would have never imagined possible. While the forerunners of the internet envisioned a decentralized internet, the rise of Big Tech has put paid to these idealistic goals.

It’s precisely why the third iteration of the World Wide Web intends to restore the balance of power from these megacorporations back to the user, through the use of blockchain technology and its inherent advantages.

Yes, we’re talking about the term first coined by Gavin Wood in 2014: Web3.
