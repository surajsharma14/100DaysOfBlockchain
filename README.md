 ## Day 1.  
# Introduction
The internet has been around for almost half a century now. Even if it is almost unrecognizable, ever since it went public in the nineties, its use remains as widespread as ever, making it one of mankind’s greatest inventions since the humble “wheel”.

Now, even if the underlying technologies remain the same, improvements in terms of quality of service and bandwidth has resulted in the internet becoming an integral part of our lives. The TCP/IP suite of protocols remain in use at various layers with its fundamental protocols still connecting devices today across the globe so as to send data in the form of text, images, audio and video.

The internet has moved away from being more than just a tool for academics, the military or government. It has redefined or reinvented the way we communicate, socialize, consume content and even take care of our daily needs. Be it digital newspapers, email, video streaming, Internet telephony, instant messaging, social networking and online shopping, all these services offered over the internet have made it indispensable.

Yet it’s not all rainbows and sunshine: the commercialization of the internet has brought about unintended consequences and threats that most would have never imagined possible. While the forerunners of the internet envisioned a decentralized internet, the rise of Big Tech has put paid to these idealistic goals.

It’s precisely why the third iteration of the World Wide Web intends to restore the balance of power from these megacorporations back to the user, through the use of blockchain technology and its inherent advantages.

Yes, we’re talking about the term first coined by Gavin Wood in 2014: Web3.


## Day 2.
 # Defining Web3
 
 While there’s no fixed definition for Web3, it’s fair to say that decentralization, blockchain technology and token economies will play a major role in its realization. As hazy as this definition truly is, let’s illustrate why Web3 can make a difference, by examining how we use the internet today.

It goes without saying that all of us use a service or product offered by Big Tech, be it Meta, Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix. If you haven’t noticed already, whenever you use these services or products, you give these companies information about your likes and dislikes.Over time, a profile of your preferences are built.



As a consequence, your data is sold to companies who would like to sell you more products or services. Literally, every keystroke and mouse click can be tracked when using their services and following which, the algorithms go about serving up more of what you want or need, based on your profile.

In fact, your ISP can literally sell your data based on your browsing history. As unsavory as that might seem, this is the current state of the internet today, where our data is monetised by faceless conglomerates for the purpose of making greater profits.

That’s not all: a change in the way content produced for the internet is monetized is necessary. In its current avatar, the internet gives you and me opportunities to produce content for centralized entities.



Yet again, names like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube come to mind where the platforms tend to “rake in the moolah” while the producers are left counting pennies. That said, let’s not even get started about content ownership just yet. There’s a lot of hype about Web3 today as it promises the average user freedom from being just another user whose data is being harvested, which is stored at centralized data centers, for greater profit. So, how does Web3 intend to do things differently?

With the elimination of the middle man - for example, Google or Meta - the centralization of data is taken out of the equation. No centralized data center or web server will hold your data anymore.In stark contrast, you will build and use apps that are on a decentralized state machine maintained by several anonymous nodes on the internet. There’s no better example than the first dapp Bitcoin which demonstrates these principles effectively.



In other words, not only will your data be protected by Web3 but you also stand to gain much more for the content produced. Best part: thanks to blockchain technology, what you produce will also be identified as yours. For everyone to see.



## Day3
# Evolution: Web1 vs. Web2 vs. Web3

Even if our definition of Web3 explains the next iteration of the internet sufficiently, our understanding of this will not be complete without understanding how we have evolved when it comes to our roles as users too.

As most people might be aware, the first iteration of the internet is now regarded to be Web1 while the second, which is said to have begun in 2004, is now collectively called Web2. Even if users today might not be aware of such changes, there was a time when we could only view static pages over the internet. Web2 gave users the ability to not only read but also produce content that was multimedia-rich in nature.



At the same time as the internet rose to prominence, Big Tech was able to achieve a degree of centralization that wasn't possible, without such advancements in technology. In fact, every industry experienced a degree of centralization, thanks to numerous mergers and acquisitions made possible by being able to build commercial products using technology.

In thriving for over two decades, Web2 has taken over each and everyone of our lives in a way that Web1 could never have, thanks to the lack of interactivity. Still, the issue is that while users get to create content of their own, it is fast becoming clear that along with being harvested for data, they aren't able to enjoy rewards for the content that they create either.

With huge platforms no doubt giving them the opportunity to showcase their talent, the system does not remunerate them, in terms of financial rewards. Worse still, there is no clear way by which ownership of content can be established as soon as it is published, shared or broadcasted on said platform. This is another aspect that Web3 seeks to correct, so as to restore power back to the content creators, by giving credit to content producers and owners alike.


## Day 4
# What are the benefits for Web3 developers?

If you’ve made it this far in the module, you’d understand that Web3 will take the internet in a completely different direction. It isn’t just the technologies that are different but just the mindset itself of what the future holds for those who have active online lives. This has far-reaching implications for Web3 developers too.

Since there are so few experienced Web3 developers, the salaries offered are very competitive, ranging between $90,000 to $150,000 a year. Even if these salaries will taper off as the industry matures, it’s time to take that leap. NOW! Particularly, if you’re looking for a solid paycheck in the area of development. Better still, there’s plenty of opportunity for growth, given how nascent the industry still is.



Now, as for the knowledge and skills necessary to make it as a Web3 developer, here’s a basic checklist to get started:
1. Blockchain Fundamentals
2. Dapps & Smart Contracts
3. Programming Languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Rust & Solidity
4. JavaScript frameworks such as Vue, Angular & React
5. JavaScript libraries such as ether.js & web3.js
6. Ethereum Fundamentals

One must remember that with blockchain development evolving rapidly, these aren’t the only skills that are in demand. There are a host of blockchain platforms that will require you to upskill in a variety of programming languages and frameworks. That said, some parts of this checklist will be covered throughout this course as we make this journey into Web3 development.

## Day 5
# Is Blockchain and Cryptocurrency the same?

Before we get into what makes up the blockchain and the Web3 stack, there’s one misconception that most people who are new to Web3 tend to have. Simply put, the terms blockchain and cryptocurrency tend to be used interchangeably.

While the blockchain and the usual cryptocurrencies on the market today are related, they’re not the same thing. For starters, a cryptocurrency is a decentralized form of currency while the blockchain is part of the underlying technology that enables the use of said cryptocurrency. Let me reiterate: these two basic elements of Web3 are not the same thing.



If anything, cryptocurrencies are but one use case of the blockchain. A prominent example of this is transacting with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. But there are several other purposes for which the blockchain comes in handy and which is why we will discuss current use cases of the blockchain in a later section.

Before we do, let’s understand what the blockchain consists of.

## Day 6
# Parts of a Blockchain
Even if Satoshi Nakamoto never explicitly used the term blockchain, the “chain of blocks” mentioned in his white paper meant the same thing.

Each block, as shown in the diagram below, contains transactions that have been carried out over the network. Once they are added to the blockchain, each chain links two consecutive blocks in the form of a unique, fixed-length hash.

![image](https://github.com/surajsharma14/100DaysOfBlockchain/assets/72158521/ce0a2c8f-503b-451c-8d2d-07494dbead62)

As shown above, this hash is generated based on the data enclosed within each block, and which is taken as input in a cryptographic hashing function. In the case of Bitcoin, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used to generate these hashes. That said, since this is a one-way hashing function, there’s no way you can obtain the data stored in each block from the generated hash value.

As for what comprises each block, the diagram above lists its contents and which will be created through the act of mining and added to the blockchain.

## Day 7
# How Transactions are Added to the Blockchain
Everything begins with a transaction between two people that requires wallets. In the case of Bitcoin, when Raghu sends some cryptocurrency to Hari, this “change” has to be recorded. In the case of fiat currency, the banks would record it on a centralized database and there would be no confusion.

In Web3, and in the absence of a centralized database keeping these records, there’s a chance of ‘double spending’. In order to avoid this, the transaction will be verified and added to the blockchain. What this will mean is that every node in the ecosystem will keep a copy of the completed and verified transaction.

https://lumos-education-portal-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/intro-to-web3/module2/2-1.jpg

When it comes to validating the transactions on the network, a reward in the form of a cryptocurrency token is offered to miners. By definition, a miner is one who validates a transaction and who will be allowed to create a block while collecting a certain amount of cryptocurrency as the aforementioned reward.

https://lumos-education-portal-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/intro-to-web3/module2/2-6.jpg


How this works is that miners have to find a Nonce - a number that can be used only once - that will become part of a solution whose output is a hash. In fact, all computers on the network focus on generating a hash that is equal to or lesser than a “target hash” determined by the network. As a result, the first node to do so gets to add said block to the blockchain after providing the proof of work which involves determining the nonce.

Otherwise known as a consensus mechanism, the proof-of-work mechanism isn’t the only type. The proof-of-stake mechanism involves staking the native token of the blockchain in order to enjoy the right to create new blocks. Adopting this type of consensus mechanism is much more energy efficient.

Lastly, it must be pointed out that there are other types of transactional data that can be stored on the blockchain, and which isn’t limited to currency values.


## Day 8
# Use Cases of the Blockchain

Even if the most prominent use case for the blockchain today has to do with cryptocurrencies, its adoption across a wide cross-section of industries was imminent, thanks to the benefits that it offers.

Financial Services
Public Sector
Internet of Things (IoT)
Personal Identity Protection
Logistics

In addition, other use cases of the blockchain have appeared in areas of gaming, real estate and art as well. Some examples of games include Crypto Kitties and Decentraland while NFT Marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible help tokenize artwork. In addition, there are solid use cases for blockchain in real estate where companies like Propy Inc, SmartRealty and RealBlocks work with international property transactions, manage rental and purchase agreements and offer real estate investing opportunities. Still, even though investment in blockchain projects has been increasing steadily since 2017, challenges such as performance speed, costs, regulation and interoperability will remain a deterrence to its acceptance as a mainstream technology.


## Day 9
# All About Tokens

Just about everyone has heard of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether. Considered to be digital assets, they’ve also been known to be called crypto tokens as well. However, with these two terms used interchangeably, it’s important to understand the difference between a token and a cryptocurrency.

While we already have cited two examples of popular cryptocurrencies, every blockchain ecosystem has its native token. But that’s not all: applications can also have their token too. In both instances, both types of tokens carry some value. The former is known as a Layer 1 token while the latter, a Layer 2 token. Not very different from conventional currency, the more tokens you have on a blockchain, the more you can do with these digital assets ranging from trading, investing or for use in other economic purposes.

https://lumos-education-portal-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/intro-to-web3/module2/2-5.jpg

However, one must also understand why tokens were first offered on a Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it as incentivizing positive behavior, which, in this case, involves validating transactions properly. Since any blockchain ecosystem wants its nodes to authenticate transactions, offering an incentive to honestly carry out this task deters them from carrying out any deceptive behavior.

While using the Bitcoin token as a starting point, a lot has transpired when it comes to the issuance of tokens ever since its inception back in 2009. Only now, we have tokens that are offered with varying purposes: DeFi, security, governance and Non-Fungible tokens are some examples of this.

https://lumos-education-portal-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/intro-to-web3/module2/2-2.jpg

Over time, it’s been understood that each blockchain creates its own microeconomy, so its tokens must suit the workings of that ecosystem. In fact, this is the reason why an entire study that delves into how cryptocurrencies and tokens work in a blockchain ecosystem has evolved and is known by the portmanteau, tokenomics.


## Day 10
# Getting Started with Web3 development: dApps & Smart Contracts

Bitcoin is the first implementation of a dApp with the simplest version of smart contracts written in Bitcoin Script.

This was until Ethereum came along and harnessed the power of blockchain technology through its platform so as to offer individuals and organizations the ability to build smart contracts to be implemented as part of the backend of dApps or as stand-alone financial instruments. For Vitalik, blockchain technology could be used in a number of use cases. Not just financial services.

https://lumos-education-portal-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/intro-to-web3/module2/2-7.jpg

If it isn’t obvious already, dApps are not very different from conventional applications that we use today, consisting of both a front-end and back-end. Given that Web3 is the next iteration of the current generation of the internet, it shouldn’t be surprising that current technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be used to build the client side. As for the back-end, this consists of smart contracts written in Solidity. At least, in the case of the Ethereum platform.

Speaking of which, you should think of smart contracts as a few lines of code - broken down into “methods” - that help you to perform transactions. The most common ones involve the transfer of financial information - receiving or sending units of cryptocurrency - based on contractual stipulations.



One interesting use case for a smart contract could involve insurance payments in case disaster strikes. There’s nothing worse than waiting for an insurance claim to come through, especially if the payments can help with the monthly bills. With a smart contract, the insurance payment will be disbursed immediately, without the need for any third party holding up these payments.

While another aspect of Web3 development involves working with the all-important consensus algorithms among other blockchain core development solutions, getting to build these Layer 1 solutions might require you to build a few Layer 2 solutions in the form of dApps and smart contracts. For this, you have to select the appropriate blockchain platform that best suits your coding skills among other technologies that are required for a fully-functioning dApp.
